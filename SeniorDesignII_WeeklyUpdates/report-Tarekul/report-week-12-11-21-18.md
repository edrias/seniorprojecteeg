# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Tarekul Islam
**Date:** 11/21/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. This aligns with our main goal of plotting channels in the head with color representing strong signals in the head. We are doing here language versus non-language. One step closer to our main goal of congruent vs incongruent.


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Filter Corrected Epoch data for Visual language and visual and visual non-language
Classify each fold and take top 20 channel importances and keep track of them for all folds
Identify the most active channels 
Identify common active channels for multiple subject files


#### M. Measurable: 
I will measure this goal by creating bar plots of channels that have highest importance for each subject than plotting them in the head map. I will compare if consistent regions in the head are active among the subjects.

#### A. Achievable: 
We have our Antduke guard cap montage in MNE now so we can visualize the head.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant to the project goal of showing areas of the head that have the signal.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Next Week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
Classify Language vs Non Language  using Random Forest
Reduce data points to 3 stats(Variance,Skew,Kurtosis) than classify using RF.
Get feature importances from RandomForest after fitting data
Run PCA for feature selection for 99%  variance in data compared to original features.
Show channels that have the signal.
