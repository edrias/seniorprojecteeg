# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Tarekul Islam
**Date:** 10/03/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Understand that data is 3 dimensional and not 2 dimensional

2. Binary classification algorithm use 2 dimension data

3. Find a way to convert 3D data to 2D

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 

#### S. Specific: 
Before I classified the data by slicing the data into 2D unknowingly not understanding how the data is formatted and the 3rd dimension is important. It contains the sample data for each channel across time. I want to start over with classifying one target and one flanker. The flanker and target should be the same stimulus. 

#### M. Measurable: 
I will measure this goal by creating bar graph of subject classification scores and measure mean,max,min, and median scores among the group. I will also plot a confusion matrix.

#### A. Achievable: 
This goal is small but necesary dummy goal to get started with to understand our data and get ourselves with some results to work with.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant goal because we are used to dealing with 2D data and now we have to learn to use 3D data in classifiers. This is first step in the I am taking with the realization that I been dealing with the data incorrectly.

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next Week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
Classified dog flanker and dog target using LogReg and LDA
Plotted average epoch of 128 channels
plot minimum channels required for 95% variance of data
Plotted average epoch of 28 channels(PCA)
Plotted mean band amplitudes using FFT
