## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Each subject is exposed to three events of flanker, target, and flanker. I want to see how the brain reacts to a set of familiar stimuli versus a set of stimuli that has two flankers the same bu the target stimulus is different. What does will our classification score look like? If it is good than why is it good. what is happening in the brain.

#### M. Measurable: 
I will measure the goal by using various classification algorithms and as well as do for many subjects to see if results are consistent. Additionally I will run cross validation and research optimal folds to use.

#### A. Achievable: 
The goal is to see what happens in the brai when subjects are exposed to congruent and incongruent stimuli. This is the first step in that direction and we start off with classification.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant to the research.


#### T. Time-bound: 
next week



## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

 Create epochs.  
 plot average epoch data
 Classify raw data same flanker vs same target data. 
 Extracted minimum components for 95% variance plot
 Classify PCA data
