## Stretch Goals (1-3)


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
After applying classification algorithm, LogReg, look at the coefficients.Classification algorithm use large positive/negative coefficients to make distinctions between classes.

Find important channels/electrode positions from the large coefficients

#### M. Measurable: 
I can measure this goal if I can show the coefficents for each channel across the samples. If I can than pinpoint from the coefficient data which channels were most important in the Logistc Regression.

#### A. Achievable: 
I will need to read sklearn Logistic Regression documentation to learn what coefficients mean and how to use them to understand which channels are important

#### R. Relevant :
This is the next step in figuring out which regions of the brain are firing together.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Next Week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
Re-evaluate epochs and format to 500 ms each, filter for only 3 events per trial, reclean data.

Classify using LDA, LDA with PCA,Logistic Regression, with confusion matrix.
