## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
I want to find the error with my anaconda/jupyter notebook installation and get caught up because I am behind.
I want to use the libeep library provided to us by Dave to read the data and do eda.

#### M. Measurable: 
I will have EEG data plots. 

#### A. Achievable: 
EDA is a very important first analysis of any data. It allows you to eyeball any noticeable problems with the data and how much it needs to be cleaned.

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next Week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
I want to map event ids to events and create epochs. 
I want to clean data than I want to classify raw data same flanker vs same target data. I want to classify using PCA data

#### M. Measurable: 
I will have plots of files with epochs and event ids on the top to show event id for event. I will filter and classify flanker vs target, the function for filtering and classying will be in the python file. I will show classification scores using two different classifiers. I will have plots of average epoched data. I will show plot of how many channels to use for PCA. 

#### A. Achievable: 
The motivation of this is to see how different are the target and flanker events from each other. Is their any noticeable difference in the EEG that a classifier might use to differentiate the two classes. Running PCA will help with understanding which channels most are useful in the classification

#### R. Relevant :
This is a dummy problem that will help with understanding how machine learning algorithms work and remind us how to use PCA.

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next Week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
I could not get my jupyter notebook to use libeep library provided to us by Dave to read the data. I had an error that I could not solve with many attempts at failure to find the problem.
