## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Calculate STD of channels for each epoch and find the abnormal channels that are above or below the STD


#### M. Measurable: 
Create a line graph of all the mean coefficients and see which channels are above and below the standard deviation

#### A. Achievable: 
This goal will require array manipulation and data analysis.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal will help differentiate the unique channels that are deviating from normal std. This could mean they are giving the high postive or negative signals.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Next Week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
Created a coefficient array for each channel. 
Too much data points so decided to reduce data points to 3 for
each channel. Took variance, skew, and kurtosis of each channel.
Than classified the new data. Than found the coefficients 125 x 3. 
Created a plot of the coefficent data.
