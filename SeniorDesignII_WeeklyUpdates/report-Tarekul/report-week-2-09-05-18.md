#### S. Specific: 
I want to read the data into MNE,do exploratory data analysis, and plot the montage file of the head to get a view of the channels on the head.

#### M. Measurable: 
I can measure progress by being able to run MNE read raw data methods and be able to plot the EEG data with channels and be able to plot the head montage using Jupyter Notebook.
