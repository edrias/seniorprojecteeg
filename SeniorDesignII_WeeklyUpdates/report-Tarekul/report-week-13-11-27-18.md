# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Tarekul Islam
**Date:** 11/27/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The goal to get congruence vs incongruent results and show signal in the brain can be done with these methods mentioned below. Only need to change the epochs when filtering from audio/visual to congruent/incongruent than feed to classifier and follow the remaining steps.


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Plot the spatial maps from feature importances and show head map in the regions where their is a spike in signal. Show the top 20 channels used to create that signal. Keep track of them across files.
Show which channels consistenly appeared in the top 20. Use those channels to classify and than plot the spatial maps of those channels.


#### M. Measurable: 
This goal will have bar graphs of channel importances as well as evoked data plots. 

#### A. Achievable: 
This goal is achievable using MNE evoked data plot joint method.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant to the overall goal of creating color maps of the head and showing regions of the brain where the decision of vidual or audio is taking place.

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next Week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
Filtered Corrected Epoch data for Visual language and visual and visual non-language
Classify each fold and take top 20 channel importances and keep track of them for all folds
Identify the most active channels 
Identify common active channels for multiple subject files
